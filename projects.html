      <p>
        Most of my projects that I have done over the course of university are saved in my GitHub Repositories. I have worked with multiple coding languages and frameworks
        including Python, Java, C, Haskell, Swift, MySQL, HTML, JavaScript, Jest, React, and Bootstrap. I primarily code in Java, but have recently been researching and practicing with
        frontend coding languages like Javascript, CSS, and HTML. I am always willing to expand my knowledge in computer science and learn new things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below I have displayed some of the biggest and most challenging, but also most fun and educative projects I have done throughout my career. To see all of my projects, view the repositories in my profile here:

              This project was one of the final assignments in my university course for iOS Development. The project was based on previous assignments we had completed, but expanded on it with
              new features or requirements that made it more difficult to complete. Coding all the files and making sure testing went as planned took a majority of the time, especially with
              testing the new features and researching the best way to implement them. <br>
              The final result is a mock Pokémon game where the user controls their character sprite with an on-screen controller and can "collect" Pokémon by running into them. When a Pokémon is captured, 
              music is played to notify the player. There is also background music playing in the app. The user can then see how many of the original 151 Pokémon they captured by clicking the Pokéball icon.

              This project utilized practices with Visitor functions in my Software Engineering course. It was assigned as a class activity to be done prior to the next meeting, but served as a 
              practice to increase our understanding of Vistor and Subject classes. <br>
              The final result is a snippit of a Street Fighter game action log. When run, the program displays the actions and damage done by certain characters from the Street Fighter franchise.

              This project was used as practice with using multiple files to execute and achieve a final reusult in earlier Java learning courses. As a whole, the project 
              tested our knowledge and capabilites of Java coding, and although challenging was very fun to code. <br>
              The final result is a small version of the card game Black Jack, in which the user sets a name for the Dealer and the Player, then cards are drawn and a score is displayed 
              which indicates who wins by higher score.

              This project was used as a final assignment in my User Interfaces course to test our knowledge and capabilites in Javascript and its frameworks. The project was 
              an extension on what we had previously worked on in the course, but with more specifications and event changes. This project was a major stepping stone in developing my website as 
              it provided crucial functionalities that I would use. <br>
              The final result is a mock Transfer Student Course Sheet in which the user can input their name and total amount of transfer credits they have. Depending on the amount of 
              transfer credits they enter, the amount of courses listed in Speaking and Writing Emphasis will change. In addition, there is an editing function in which users can 
              change and input data into the tables to more accurately detail the classes.

              This project is one of and currently my largest personel project that I have been working on. I started my website with a local save in the beginning of my final semester, and 
              have been improving on the pages and functions as I learned more about Javascript through courses and HTML and CSS through my own research. <br> 
              The final result is what you see here, and through all the pages you can navigate. I wanted my website to show a part of who I am and what I aspire to be as a 
              Computer Scientist and Developter. I will continue adding to this site as more experiences and techniques are learned, but I am very proud of what I have been able to achieve thus far.
