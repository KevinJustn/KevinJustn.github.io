      <h2>To begin, my name is Kevin Louis Jusino</h2>
      <p>I am the second of three children in my family, being born in May 2001.<p>
      <p>I love to spend my free time doing many things, including but not limited to: </p>
        • Working on projects like my website or small projects on LeetCode. <br>
        • Playing video games on my computer or switch.<br>
        • Going on hikes up mountains or exploring new areas.<br>
        • Going to the park to play with friends or get some exercise.<br>
        • Watching movies, shows, and anime. <br></p>

      <p>I love to travel with family and friends to differnent placces, although I've never been outside the United States. I have visted most of the states along the East Coast and been to popular attractions such as Universal Studios Florida, Niagra Falls, and Long Island, NY.</p>

      <p>I mainly hike around local trails in the area, espeically in the Pocono Mountains. My friends will sometimes do hike that take half a day to complete, spanning over several miles. The views are always worth the effort. </p>

      <p>In 2022, I went to my first ever Renaissance Fair. Although I didn't know what to expect, it was very fun and exciting to watch the plays and reenactments. I also got to dress up and go with my friends and family. </p>

      </p>

      <p>I love to program and develop projects, as nothing beats the feeling of having a working result. My most recent project has been this website you are navigating, as this is using both knowledge I have learned from my university courses as well as self-taught mechanics and processes.</p>
      <p>My goal is to find a career that will let me reach my full potential and support me along the way to improve my computer science and development skills. </p>
