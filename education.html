      <h1><br>My Education</h1>

      <p> I graduated from Jim Thorpe Area High School in June 2019. From there, I initially went to Penn State University Main Campus at State College, PA. I originally pursued
        a degree in Electrical Engineering, but after the first year, and the Covid-19 Pandemic, I realized that this major was not what I wanted. The Penn State University itself 
        is an amazing campus and I am glad I got to experience my first year of college there. However, with my change of majors I was also looking for a change of university, which 
        would lead to my transfer to West Chester University.</p>

      </p>

      <p>I would change majors at PSU in the Spring 2020 semester, then soon after input my transfer to West Chester University where I continued my education in Fall 2020
         and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science with Summa Cum Laude honors. I also earned my Computer Security Certificate through the Computer 
         Security Program at West Chester University. </p>

      <p>I am glad I attended both of these colleges, even in trying times of the world. I have learned so much from so many different people at both universities, and I would
        not change anything if I could.<br>I am proud 2023 WCU Graduate and Alumni. Rams Up!</p>
